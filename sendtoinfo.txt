# Windows Send To Menu Integration

## How it works:

The Windows "Send to" menu appears when you right-click on files in Windows Explorer. To add custom entries to this menu, you need to place shortcuts or executables in the special "SendTo" folder.

**Send To Folder Location:**
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo\

**For this application:**
1. The configuration tool creates a batch file that calls our Python script
2. This batch file is copied to the SendTo folder
3. When users right-click files and select "Send to Raspberry Pi", Windows passes the selected file paths as command-line arguments to our script

**Command Line Arguments:**
- Windows automatically passes the full paths of selected files as arguments
- Our Python script receives these via sys.argv[1:]
- Multiple files are supported automatically

**Integration Steps:**
1. User runs raspfilesend_config.py to set up connection
2. Clicks "Install Send To Menu" which copies the batch file to SendTo folder
3. Right-click context menu now shows "Send to Raspberry Pi" option
4. Selecting this option launches raspfilesend_transfer.py with selected files as arguments

**Benefits:**
- Seamless integration with Windows Explorer
- No need to open separate applications
- Works with single or multiple file selections
- Native Windows user experience
